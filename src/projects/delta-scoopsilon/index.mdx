## Info

This design was made to accompany DU's fall 2023 philanthropy event, Delta Scoopsilon. The design features a custom 3D-modeled ice cream cone along with a truck and text. The event benefitted DU International's philanthropic organization, [Global Service Initiative](https://www.deltau.org/global-service-initiative), raising over $8,500 from sponsors. Their logos were traced and incorporated on the back.
